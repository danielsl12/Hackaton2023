How much does it cost?

in a public hospital adjacent to the place of residence or the place of the incident.
What should you do?

 If you have an entitlement to funding from Maccabi, you have not yet paid for the evacuation by ambulance and 85 days from the date of evacuation have not passed - you should contact the Maccabi Medical Center to produce a commitment for the evacuation. The branch office will transfer the pledge directly to the MDA or the ambulance company in the agreement.
 If you have an entitlement to funding from Maccabi, you have not yet paid for the evacuation by ambulance and 85 days have passed from the date of evacuation - you must pay the voucher independently and then access the medical center's offices with the original receipt and a letter of release from the ER to receive a refund.
 If you have an entitlement to funding from Maccabi and paid the eviction voucher independently - you should contact the medical center's offices with the original receipt and a letter of release from the ER for reimbursement.
 For a commitment from the medical center you must bring the voucher for payment of the ambulance company and a letter of release from the ER.
 If you paid the eviction voucher via the Internet â€” you must bring the medical center's office a printed receipt from the Internet with the original MDA billing notice and a letter of release from the ER. Only after reviewing the case and confirmation will the medical center be able to make the refund, based on the original receipt.

For a refund, apply for a refund on the Maccabi Online website or app and attach the required documents.

If necessary, the documents can also be submitted at an appointment at the medical center or sent by registered mail to the medical center.

 

The required documents:

 Original receipt of payment to the ambulance company.
 Letter of release from ER

What else is worth knowing?

 Maccabi produces an automatic commitment to MDA. However, if you received a reminder about debt to MDA, it is your responsibility to contact the medical center for debt regulation in order not to accrue interest and attorney expenses.
 The funding from Maccabi would not include retainers and a lawyer, if there were, but only the basic amount of the ambulance evacuation.
 Evacuation of a student by ambulance - the eligibility is the same as the eligibility of all Maccabi members.

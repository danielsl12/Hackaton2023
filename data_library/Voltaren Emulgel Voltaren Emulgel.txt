     What is it for?

     Diclofenac is a drug that belongs to the family of drugs called "non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs" (NSAID). It reduces inflammatory processes and relieves pain.

     Diclofenac is marketed in Israel in several preparations for internal use (including tablets, suppositories and injection), eye drops and preparations for external use. The information provided here refers to preparations for external use.

     Diclofenac for external use is used for local relief of pain and inflammation (such as back pain or muscle pain) that may be caused by overexertion, local trauma, inflammation and sports injuries.

     Voltran series for external use
     Voltran is marketed - among other things - in a gel for external use (sometimes mistakenly called "Voltran Ointment" or "Voltran Cream", although it is a product for external use with the texture of a gel). The gel is marketed in two different strengths:

     Voltaren Emulgel 1%.

     Voltaren Forte Emulgel 2%.

     Voltaren Emulgel preparations are intended for adults and adolescents from the age of 12 years and older.

     Diclofenac is also marketed in patches and spray.

     Dicloplast patch is used to relieve inflammation and local pain (such as back pain or muscle and joint pain). It is intended for those aged 16 and over.

     Swiss Relief spray is also designed to relieve inflammation and local pain. The spray sprays a gel with a strength of 4% and is intended for those aged 15 and over.

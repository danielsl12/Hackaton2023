general comment

The information in the guide is not a substitute for advice or a basis for a medical diagnosis. For more detailed information on the drugs, please refer to the consumer leaflet, as approved by the Ministry of Health. For any further questions, consult the attending physician or the pharmacist.
What is it for?

Fusidic acid is an antibiotic that is used to treat infections caused by bacteria that are sensitive to this antibiotic (mainly staphylococcal bacteria which are bacteria found on the skin).

Fosidic acid is marketed in Israel in tablets (trade name: Fosidin Lao), eye drops (trade name Posithalmic) and preparations for external use on the skin (Fosidin Ointment, Fosidin Cream and Stephiderm Cream). The information provided here refers to the drug for external use (for the skin).

Fucidin ointment, Fucidin cream and Stafiderm cream are used to treat a local skin infection caused by bacteria from the staphylococci family (usually these are skin wounds or skin rashes caused by the presence of the bacteria).

The difference between an ointment and a cream is the degree of greasiness of the preparation: the ointment is more oily than the cream and absorbs more slowly into the skin, but sometimes is more effective than the cream. On the other hand, the cream has a more pleasant texture, is less greasy and is quickly absorbed by the skin. The doctor decides whether to use a cream or an ointment, depending on the state of the inflammation.

Fucidin ointment or Fucidin cream are not intended for the treatment of fungi as fungi do not respond to antibiotics. In the case of skin fungus, an antifungal preparation should be used. The doctor or the pharmacist should be consulted regarding the most appropriate preparation for the existing medical condition.

Fusidine ointment and Fusidine cream are not intended for the treatment of burns. In the case of a burn, consult the doctor or the pharmacist regarding the most suitable preparation for the existing medical condition.

Fusidine paste or Fusidine cream are not intended for the treatment of acne (pimples). If you suffer from acne, you should consult your doctor or pharmacist regarding the appropriate product to treat this problem.

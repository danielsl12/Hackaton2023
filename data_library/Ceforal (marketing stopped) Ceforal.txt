Important warnings

• The medical history. Before starting to use the medicine, the attending physician must be informed of the medical history: current and past medical conditions and illnesses. He must also be informed of any additional medication that is taken, including dietary supplements and herbs.

• Hypersensitivity to cephalosporins. Cephalexin belongs to a family of antibiotic drugs known as cephalosporins. The drug may cause hypersensitivity which can be manifested by symptoms such as rash on the skin, swelling of the skin, swelling of the mouth or throat or peeling of the skin. The attending physician should be reported if the personal medical history includes hypersensitivity to other drugs from the cephalosporin family or penicillin. If, while taking the drug, side effects that indicate hypersensitivity are experienced, the use of the drug should be stopped and the attending physician should be contacted immediately.

• Penicillin sensitivity. Those who are sensitive to penicillin should report this to the attending physician. A small proportion of patients who are sensitive to penicillin may also be sensitive to Cephalexin.

• Renal failure. If you suffer from decreased kidney function or kidney failure, you must report this to your doctor. In cases of kidney failure, the doctor is expected to prescribe a reduced dose of the drug. Follow the doctor's instructions.

• Laboratory tests. Before blood tests or urine tests, the doctor must be informed about taking this medicine. The drug may affect the results of the INR test among patients taking Coumadin as well as affect the results of other tests (such as the COOMBS test used to diagnose hemolytic anemia).

• treatment duration. It is necessary to observe the duration of use of the medicine as ordered by the attending physician. It is forbidden to shorten or extend the duration of use without consulting the attending physician.

• Prolonged use, beyond the treatment period prescribed by the attending physician, may cause infection of the digestive tract with the bacterium Clostridium difficile - even months after the end of using the medicine. Diarrhea is a common side effect of antibiotics and usually should not be a concern, but you should contact your doctor if you suffer from abdominal pain, significant diarrhea, abdominal cramps and the appearance of blood or mucus in the stool.

These symptoms may be accompanied by a high fever.

• Acute diarrhea, watery stools, bloody stools, abdominal pain, spasms in the stomach and digestive system.

Drug interactions

• Before starting to use the medicine, you must report to the attending physician any other medicine you are taking or should take, including nutritional supplements and herbs.

• Probenazid, a medicine for the treatment of gout (gout), may increase the levels of cephalexin in the blood and increase the frequency of its side effects.

• Cephalexin may increase the level of metformin (a medicine to treat diabetes) in the blood. However, in most cases, cephalexin and metformin can be taken in combination.

• Cephalexin may impair the effectiveness of sodium picosulfate, a drug used to clean the intestines before surgeries and before diagnostic procedures (such as colonoscopy).

• Cephalexin may prolong the time required for blood clotting, so if it is taken with anticoagulants such as warfarin, it may cause an increase in INR levels and bleeding. If the combination of Cephalexin and anticoagulants is essential for the patient, he must have regular and frequent monitoring of the INR levels in his blood.

• Taking probiotics may reduce the effectiveness of cephalexin. It is recommended to observe a period of two hours between taking probiotics and taking Cephalexin.

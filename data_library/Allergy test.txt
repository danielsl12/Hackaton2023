Calling a doctor's appointment

         Make an appointment to perform the test at the laboratory or at the Maccabi Medical Center.

What else should you know?

The right to check is a unique right for members of Maccabi Sheli, Maccabi Gold and Maccabi Silver. Anyone who is not a member of one of these insurance programs will not be able to perform the test, not even at full price.

The payment is per referral, regardless of the amount of allergens appearing in the referral or the number of tests.

A new application will require payment of the deductible again.

Avoid taking antihistamines (any anti-allergy medicine) for 7 days before the test. Taking antihistamines does not allow performing a skin test to find out an allergy.
